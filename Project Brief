Security Operations Centre (SOC) Fundamentals: I understand the importance of SOCs in detecting, analysing, and responding to security incidents in real-time.

Alert Handling: I am familiar with the process of monitoring, triaging, and responding to alerts generated by security systems.

Cybersecurity Frameworks: Knowledge of established frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK, which helps identify tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by cyber adversaries.

SIEM Functionality: I know how Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems collect, analyse, and store log data from various network sources to provide insights into potential security threats.

Responding to Alerts: I have learned how to effectively respond to security alerts by gathering necessary evidence, analysing it for malicious activities, and formulating detailed notes for incident escalation or resolution.

Triage Tools & Techniques: I learned how to use tools for triaging security incidents, sorting through alerts to identify real threats and eliminate false positives quickly.

Walkthrough of Attacks: I gained an understanding of how to interpret and track real-world cyberattacks by studying attack walkthroughs, offering insights into attack patterns, and learning to spot vulnerabilities.

🌐 Network Traffic Analysis:
Through the home project, I have demonstrated how to detect and analyse malicious network traffic using tools like Suricata and Wireshark, reinforcing the importance of proactive detection in network defence. This includes identifying suspicious patterns such as ICMP ping floods, HTTP POST requests with malicious payloads, and SSH brute force attacks.

For a deeper dive into all the strategies and techniques I’ve learned and applied, check out the detailed report and all the snapshots of Suricata usage, adding rules, testing and detecting!! [🔗 https://lnkd.in/e2NGttXp ].
